# Hello-CPP

This repository is simply something I made to keep track of the things I'm learning in C++ that I feel I need to play around with and write down explanations myself to fully grasp. It also serves as a reference for the future me (and anyone else who would be interested in learning with me!

## Huge shoutout to TheCherno
I have been following his C++ YouTube tutorial as well as using it as a reference to write this reference in turn. I **highly** recommend anyone interested in learning or expanding their skills in C++ to check him out. His videos are very high quality, super interesting, and explain things at a very deep level compared to many other tutorials out there.
